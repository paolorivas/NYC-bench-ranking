# Using Data Science to find the Best Bench to sit in New York City
New york is home to one of the highest pedestrian populations- and when you walk so much, you surely want to sit down for a little rest too! In this document, we take you through the 'Behind the scenes' of ranking NYC public benches with essential amenities around, so that you know the best ones to go for stretching a leg.

We begin with importing the most important packages in python for the purpose of our ranking. This includes Pandas, Seaborn as well as sci-kit criteria. Here is a little information about each of these packages: pandas is a Python package which aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real-world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis/manipulation tool available in any language.
